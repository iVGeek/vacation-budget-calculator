# Vacation Budget Calculator

A daily vacation budget calculator to see how much money the user had available each day for food and fun.

## Objectives

1. Use querySelectors to select a button that activates prompts to find out the user's total budget, their accomodation costs, and how long the trip will be, as well as to target the paragraph where the calculated budget will display.
2. Write a function to collect information about the user's budget, accomodation costs, and number of vacation days, using the prompt and Number methods to collect the information and convert it into a number.
3. Use a click event to run the information collecting function.
4. Write a second function to use the information collected, using the toFixed method to round the number to cents.
